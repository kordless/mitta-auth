# mitta-auth
A password-less Python Flask Auth Module

Mitta Auth is a password-less authentication system written for Mitta.us. 

Authentication systems are difficult to implement. A simplified and secure authentication system is presented that prioritizes end user's rights while still remaining easy to implement and use.

## Passwords are Ridiculous
Over time, passwords become difficult to remember and may be stored in various systems which themselves require passwords for access and which may be comprimised by other means.

At the same time, passwords may be ignored in these systems when using forgotten password functions. Mitta Auth uses a "forgotten password" authentication flow to authenticate users quickly and easily.
